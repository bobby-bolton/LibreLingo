# Contributing to LibreLingo courses

LibreLingo courses consist of files that contain course content. These files
are organized in a specific directory structure.

## Creating a new course

Before creating a new course, it's recommended that you first contribute to
existing courses. [Learn how to edit or create courses](editing-courses.md). In order to create a
new course and get it published, you'll probably need some technical assistance
as at this stage, several things might not be automated.

You can start off by creating your pull request. I'll get to help with the
pull requests as soon as possible.

## Languages that don't use the Latin alphabet

Currently LibreLingo doesn't have enough features to support teaching new
alphabets. Solving this is a priority, but will take time. Technically in most
cases, language pairs that use the same alphabet (for example Ukranian for
Russian spakers) should work just fine, but it hasn't been tested yet.
